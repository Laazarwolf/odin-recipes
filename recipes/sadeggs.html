    <h3>So sad to be all alone in the world</h3>

    <p>This is possibly the worst way to prepare eggs.  There really
        isn't any way to do less and still call it a recipe.  I mean I 
        guess you could just put some eggs in a bowl without cracking 
        them... but that would just be <a href="">lazy eggs</a>, not sad.
